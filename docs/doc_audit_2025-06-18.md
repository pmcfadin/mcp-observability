# Documentation Audit – 18 Jun 2025

_This file was generated as part of issue #94 (docs audit & restructure)._
Each markdown file in the repo is categorised as **KEEP** (no change), **UPDATE** (needs edits / relocation / rename), or **ARCHIVE** (move to `docs/archive/`).

## 1. KEEP – no changes required

- `docs/dashboards.md`
- `docs/security_tls.md`
- `docs/contributing/index.md` *(stub – will be fleshed out in #95)*

## 2. UPDATE / MOVE

| Current Path | Target Path / Action | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| `README.md` | rewrite in place (#96) | Reduce size, add diagram, TOC |
| `docs/Docker Getting Started.md` | `docs/guides/docker.md` (#97) | Minor tweaks & rename |
| `docs/Kubernetes Getting Started.md` | `docs/guides/kubernetes.md` (#98) | Expand Helm sections |
| `docs/Using for local development.md` | integrate into `docs/guides/docker.md` | Overlaps – merge content |
| `docs/Working within an existing environment.md` | `docs/guides/external-stack.md` (#99) | Partial-component / existing stack guide |
| `docs/Project CI.md` | `docs/contributing/ci.md` (#95) | Contributor docs |
| `docs/orchestration_prompt.md` | `docs/contributing/workflow.md` (#95) | Contributor workflow |

| *(future)* language guides | new files in `docs/observability/` | #101-#105 |

## 3. ARCHIVE (move to `docs/archive/`)

- `docs/mcp-observability-prd.md` – historical PRD, keep for reference.
- `docs/observability.md` – duplicated info covered elsewhere.

Once the moves are implemented we'll update internal links and the README TOC.
