# AI Agent Orchestration Prompt ‚Äì **mcp-observability**

> Use this playbook whenever an autonomous agent (or human acting as one) needs to pick work, create issues, and log progress in this repository.

---

## 1 ¬∑ Goals

1. Always work **inside a tracked GitHub Issue**.
2. Keep the open‚Äêissue rate ‚â§ 5 per hour (see Cursor rule ¬ß6).
3. Follow the *Create-Before-Code* policy ‚Äì no code without an issue.
4. Ensure transparent progress logging through comments and commits on `main`.

---

## 2 ¬∑ Pre-requisites

* GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated and in the repo root.
* `git` configured with an email/username the team recognises.
* CI passes automatically on every push to `main`.

---

## 3 ¬∑ High-Level Flow

  A(List open epics) --> B(Select highest-priority epic)

  C -->|Some open| E(Pick a child issue)
  D --> E
  E --> F(Comment "‚è≥ Started")
  F --> G(Implement work, commit, push to main)
  G --> H(CI passes)
  H --> I(Close child issue & comment on epic)
  I --> J(If all child issues closed ‚Üí close epic)
```

---

## 4 ¬∑ Detailed Steps & Command Snippets

### 4.1  List open epics

```bash
# Show all open epics (parent issues)
gh issue list --label epic --state open --limit 20 | cat
```

Choose the top-priority epic (oldest `created_at` or based on label `P0`, `P1`, etc.).

---

### 4.2  Inspect the epic

```bash
EPIC_ID=1  # example
gh issue view $EPIC_ID | cat
```

*The issue body contains an unchecked checklist of child tasks.*

---

### 4.3  Create missing child issue (max 5/hr)

If the task you want to tackle is only a checklist item (no linked issue yet):

```bash
CHILD_TITLE="Implement /health endpoint"
gh issue create \
  --title "$CHILD_TITLE" \
  --body "Tracks #$EPIC_ID\n\nAcceptance Criteria: ‚Ä¶" \
  --label ai-task --assignee @me | cat

# Link it back to the epic
NEW_ID=$(gh issue list --search "$CHILD_TITLE" --json number -q '.[0].number')
gh issue comment $EPIC_ID "Tracks #$NEW_ID" | cat
```

---

### 4.4  Start work on a child issue

```bash
CHILD_ID=42  # issue you picked
gh issue comment $CHILD_ID "‚è≥ Started." | cat
```

---

### 4.5  Commit workflow

```bash
# After meaningful progress
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add health endpoint (refs #$CHILD_ID)"

git push origin main
```

---

### 4.6  Close the loop

```bash
COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

gh issue close $CHILD_ID --comment "‚úÖ Done in $COMMIT_HASH." | cat
```

Then update the epic:

```bash
gh issue comment $EPIC_ID "‚úÖ Completed sub-task #$CHILD_ID" | cat

# If no unchecked tasks remain, close epic
if ! gh issue view $EPIC_ID --json taskLists -q '.taskLists[].items[] | select(.state=="OPEN")' | grep -q .; then
  gh issue close $EPIC_ID --comment "‚úÖ Done. See commits on main." | cat
fi
```

---

## 5 ¬∑ Etiquette & Limits

| Rule | Reminder |
| ---- | -------- |
| **‚â§ 5 issues/hour** | Batch child issues ‚Äì don't spam. |
| **Logs** | Use emojis: ‚è≥ Started, üöß Progress, ‚ùó Need input, ‚úÖ Done. |
| **Secrets** | Never paste tokens or credentials. |
| **Commits** | Push small, self-contained commits directly to `main`. |

---

## 6 ¬∑ Troubleshooting

* **gh authentication errors** ‚Äì run `gh auth login` again.
* **Label missing** ‚Äì create it: `gh label create ai-task --color BFD4F2`.
* **CI failing** ‚Äì comment `üöß CI failing, investigating` on the issue to log status.
